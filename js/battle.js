// ---------- Note: These are just notes for myself to look back on and further comments on the events from above ----------

// --- THE "IF" STATEMENTS ---
// The reason why #2 - #5 are all "if" statements and not "if, else if, else" blocks was 
// because we wanted to be able to check all conditions i.e., whether the computer or user 
// was "dead" or had enough HP to still "do damage" (as stated in the assignment)
// If the player is "alive", keep "doing damage" to its opponent.
// If the player is "dead", end the game because the winner has been declared and the player already "died".

// --- THE ISSUE ---
// I originally had it in an "if, else if" block, however, when using an "if, else if" block only one statement can be true 
// but again, we want both conditions to be checked not just one of them.
// When using the "if, else if" block, I had an issue where the computer's HP was 0/1000, 
// no winner message was printed to the DOM and the user's HP was 500/1000.
// I had to click one more time to have the winner message show up and the user HP was 400/1000
// but I wanted it to show up right when the computer's HP was at 0/1000.

// --- THE REASON ---
// The reason that happened was because let's say the user clicks "attack" multiple times where the computer's HP reached 200/1000.
// When the computer's HP was 200, it went through the "if" statement: if(computerCurrentHealth > 0), subtracted 200 from it's HP
// and then stopped there since the statement was true but it didn't check whether the computer's HP was 0 
// or in other words, it wasn't going to the "else if" block but the computer's HP was already at 0/1000 while the user's HP was at 500/1000.
// So when I clicked on the "attack" button again, the computer's HP was still 0/1000 but the user HP was at 400/1000 and the winner message printed
// or in other words, at that time, it went through the "if else" block and checked whether it was actually
// less than or equal to 0 and proceeded with executing the following statements

// --- THE RESULT ---
// Now that I've created each condition in an "if" block, when the user clicks "attack" all conditions will be checked one at a time from top to bottom
// and as soon as the user or computer has "died", the user's or computer's HP does not decrease further and the 
// winner message is printed to the DOM right when either the user's or computer's HP is equal to 0
